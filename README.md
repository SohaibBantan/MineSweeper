Minesweeper Game
A Java-based Minesweeper game that combines logic, strategy, and object-oriented programming principles. This project is designed to replicate the classic Minesweeper experience with customizable difficulty levels, robust debugging features, and an interactive console-based interface.

📜 Overview
This Minesweeper game allows players to choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, with varying grid sizes and mine counts. The game supports features such as flag placement, debug mode for internal state visualization, and automated area revealing for zero-value cells.

🛠️ Features
Dynamic Grid Sizing: Supports 5x5, 9x9, and 20x20 grids for different difficulty levels.
Flag Placement: Allows players to strategically mark suspected mine locations.
Debug Mode: Reveals the entire minefield, enabling players to view the behind-the-scenes state of the grid.
Advanced Logic: Implements intelligent area revealing for zero-value cells and efficient mine placement that avoids the starting position.
Interactive Console UI: Engages users with prompts for inputs and real-time game status updates.
🏁 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later.
Basic knowledge of how to compile and run Java programs from the terminal.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

📂 Project Structure
Main.java: Entry point of the game, managing user input, game flow, and interactions with the Minefield class.
Minefield.java: Core game logic, including mine placement, cell evaluation, and gameplay mechanics.

🚀 How to Play
Start the program and select your desired difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
Enter starting coordinates in the form of row,column to reveal a cell and initiate the game.
During the game, input your moves in the format row,column,yes/no to either reveal a cell or place/remove a flag.
Win the game by successfully flagging all mines without triggering one!

🧪 Debug Mode
Enable debug mode at the start of the game to view the internal minefield state. This is useful for testing or understanding the game's logic.

💡 Future Enhancements
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Transition from a console-based UI to a fully interactive graphical interface.
Improved Game Mechanics: Introduce additional features like timers, leaderboards, and custom difficulty settings.
